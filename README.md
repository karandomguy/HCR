# Handwritten Character Recogniton(HCR) # 
HCR is a real time character recognition application that detects and recognizes the characters from the showcasing real time video. The video is captured and passed onto the model using openCV and the model is uses Convolutional Neural networks(CNN) to recognise the characters. For the deployment the model uses streamlit framework.
